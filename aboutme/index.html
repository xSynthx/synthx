          <p>I am a 16 year old high school student in the United States! I
            started hacking when I was about 14 years old, it all started when
            someone told me about this thing called <a href="http://tails.boum.org">Tails.</a>
              I asked them about it, and they started telling me, "its something
              called a live boot USB" and they were telling me how it worked and
              what it did, so I went home that night fascinated, I looked tails
              up, and how to make it live boot. I then started looking up other
              live boot USB's not knowing the correct terms for it (Operating
              Systems). My first one that I ever booted up was "Anonymous OS". I
              know right?!? You gotta start somewhere though. Then came along a
              church that my dad was gonna start running sound for. I was lonely
              there at first until one day a kid come up and sat next to me and
              said "is that terraria". Me and him are now really good friends. I
              started to learn more about Linux live USB's. Then came along this
              distro called Kali Linux. I extracted it to a flashdrive and
              booted it up. I found something called SQLMap. I was very curious
              about this thing called SQLMap, so I looked it up on google, found
              a beginner guide to it. I then found a website that was vulnerable
              to the injection. I dropped the entire database. This is all where
              my adventures about hacking started! I now know little SQLi, I
              know about holding sessions on people (reverse shell scripts), and
              currently learning more! I own a hacker forums called <a href="http://thehackercommunity.com">The Hacker
            Community!</a> It isnt that popular yet, but I am trying my best to
              promote it. I also am a programmer. I am pretty good at HTML, and
              CSS. I am also currently learning python. <br>
